# WDD 131 – Dynamic Web Fundamentals

This repository contains my assignments and projects for WDD 131: Dynamic Web Fundamentals (BYU–Pathway Worldwide).
The course focuses on building interactive, data-driven, and responsive web pages using HTML, modern CSS, and JavaScript.

The work here demonstrates how static pages can be enhanced with DOM manipulation, user interaction, and browser APIs.
