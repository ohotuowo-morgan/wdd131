            <p>
                DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, refers to a new financial system built on blockchain
                technology that removes the need for traditional banks or intermediaries. Instead of relying
                on centralized institutions, DeFi uses smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum to enable
                peer-to-peer financial transactions — allowing anyone to lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest
                without needing permission or credit checks.

            <h2>How DeFi Works</h2>
            <img src="./images/defi.svg" alt="people holding money" loading="lazy">
            <p>
                DeFi platforms are powered by <strong>smart contracts</strong> — self-executing codes that run
                automatically when conditions are met. These contracts operate on decentralized networks,
                ensuring transparency and eliminating the risk of manipulation by a single entity.
                Users connect through <strong>crypto wallets</strong> to interact directly with DeFi protocols,
                participating in activities such as liquidity provision, staking, and yield farming.

        <section id="benefits">
            <h2>Why DeFi Matters</h2>
            <p>
                DeFi represents the future of open finance — empowering individuals with full control of their assets
                and eliminating traditional barriers like bank accounts, credit history, and geographical limits.
                It fosters financial inclusion, innovation, and transparency, paving the way for a borderless
                digital economy.

            <h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                While DeFi offers freedom and innovation, it’s still evolving. Risks include smart contract bugs,
                price volatility, and scams from unverified platforms. Users should always conduct due diligence
                and use reputable protocols to protect their assets.

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>The Future of DeFi</h2>
            <p>
                As technology advances, DeFi continues to expand beyond Ethereum into ecosystems like Solana,
                Polygon, and Avalanche. Its potential to reshape global finance is immense — creating a more open,
                transparent, and user-driven financial world.
